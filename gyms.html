    <h3>Why take gyms?</h3>
    <p>The short answer is that it is the only goal that GO has given us besides catching them all, and catching them all is kind of ridiculous particularly because legendaries haven't even been released yet. The long answer [actually shorter in text] is "Fame, fortune, and those nice bonuses you get every 23 hours!"</p>

    <h3>Which gyms should be attacked?</h3>
    <p>If you are reading this, you were probably interested in the easiest way possible to get those sweet, sweet bonuses. It turns out that the path of least resistance is often the best one to take when capturing gyms, meaning that there are two things to look for in a gym:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Few/weak occupants</li>
      <li>Less frequented locations</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If the occupants are weak, your strong pokemon won't have to be revived and then given potions before you can throw them into the gym, capturing it for your team. If their are less occupants, multiple people attacking at the same time can very easily defeat a powerful defender, even with low level attackers. Having fewer occupants also help the hostile takeover more quick, meaning that other players nearby will be less likely to throw their pokemon into the unoccupied gym. Finally, if the gym is in a less frequented location, their are two primary benefits: less players may be around to disrupt the capturing the process, and the gym will be less likely to be attacked once it is developed, letting you load pokemon into other gyms to help maximize your daily bonus.</p>

      <h2>Guidelines for attacking gyms:</h2>
      <div>
        <p>The theories about taking gyms are:</p>
        <h4>If you build it, they will come</h4>
        <p>It should be noted that both theories are correct, however the one you decide to practice depends on whether you prefer an attacking based strategy or a more defensive strategy. The "If you build it they will come" strategy hinges on attacking every gym you can and hoping that your team can fortify it. The only issue is that because there are 3 teams, less than half of the people playing are actually there to help you, making the odds of the newly minted gym being attacked by the first person who sees it rather high. This strategy is effecive for giving the other teams grief, but not for securing your team's bonuses.</p>
        <h4>If you all build it, they will fear you</h4>
        <p>Are you a team player? Or maybe you are just running low on revives.... Anyways, this building strategy is both the most difficult and the most efficient strategy players have demonstrated so far. To successfully execute this strategy, a group of at least 3 should either find a weak enemy gym to pillage or find a weak friendly gym to build up. To succesfully carry out a takeover using this strategy, the gym in question must be either small or weak (if friendly: level 2, 3 or 4 with leader cp below strongest pokemon in fortifying party's cp), and once it has been taken over, the weakest fortifiers will put their strongest pokemon into the gym, allowing the stronger ones to continually train up the gym to accomodate all of the people fortifying it. The downfalls of this strategy are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>It's kind of difficult to mobilize people, get them to the right spot, and not have the game crash</li>
            <li>This makes big, scary gyms that become targets for other teams</li>
          </ul>
      </div>
    <h3>A brief reminder concerning items:</h3>
          <p>Both processes end up using a lot of items: revives and potions can be burnt up really quickly. Make sure to go to plenty of pokestops befor working on gyms.</p>
